// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

function is_odd_or_even(number):
if number modulo 2 equals 0:
return "Even"
else:
return "Odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

function main():
    numbers = []  # Create an empty list to store the numbers
    
    # Read in 5 separate numbers
    for i = 1 to 5:
        input_number = read_input()  # Read input from user
        numbers.append(input_number)  # Add the number to the list
    
    # Calculate the average of the five numbers
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    
    # Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the 5 entered numbers
    minimum = find_minimum(numbers)
    maximum = find_maximum(numbers)
    
    # Write out the results
    write_output(average, minimum, maximum)

function calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    average = total / length(numbers)
    return average

function find_minimum(numbers):
    minimum = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number < minimum:
            minimum = number
    return minimum

function find_maximum(numbers):
    maximum = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > maximum:
            maximum = number
    return maximum

function write_output(average, minimum, maximum):
    print("The average of the five numbers is:", average)
    print("The smallest number is:", minimum)
    print("The largest number is:", maximum)

main()  # Call the main function to start the program
